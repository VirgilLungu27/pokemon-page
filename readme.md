This is a page showcasing Pokemon in a competitive sense, with quick access to general information, sets and abilities.

This is the first page to be pushed to main. It contains the first test pokemon (Bulbasaur) with its stats, recommended moves and for now links towards Bulbapedia pages for its evolution and the full Pokemon list.

UPDATE: Now updated to alpha v0.2.10, this page has links towards all the moves recommended for Bulbasaur, with transform properties applied.
